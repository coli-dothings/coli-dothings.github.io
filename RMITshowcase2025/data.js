    bio: "28 years of life has led me to understand lots of different things and produce a decent catalogue of designs. I have experience with visual projection mapping for musical performances, designing my own t-shirts and clothing, performing live as a DJ and as a drummer, animating and producing music for my own cartoons. I really do enjoy doing lots of different things, constant in improvement is my motivation for life. I love to create and destroy things, this is my happy place. Experimenting will usually take place at a computer when I am drawing, making a video or a song, twiddling with Touch Designer to make the screen go a bit funny. Professionally, I try to blend this playful experimentation with what best suits each work. Using my love cartoons, electronic dance music and many more things to construct my designs.",

          "Koalas in Kilts was a spatial audio piece I made to be played in with multiple speakers. Returning home from living in Glasgow, I was living with my parents (Dad is Scottish) and was feeling very disconnected with the place I called home (Australia). Having no kitchen and a construction site happening at my family home, I was feeling pretty stressed and melancholy. This audio piece used this idea as inspiration and to construct it I recorded many instances with family, Australian wildlife and construction, outside and within my own home. Australia and Scotland are quite different in the way they sound.",

The composition weaves these organic soundscapes with binaural frequencies, designed to evoke a meditative and immersive listening experience. By blending the rhythmic patterns of wildlife with the steady ambience of natural environments, the piece aims to restore a sense of calm and connection between humans and nature. Its fluid spatial design allows it to be presented in surround-sound installations or adapted for sound therapy sessions, where listeners can experience the therapeutic effects of natural acoustics.

That spirit of delightful pessimism still runs through his work, which often delves into digital chaos, fractured identity, and the absurdity of modern life.<br />Driven by a love for visual storytelling and emerging technologies, Thai's practice sits at the intersection of art, design, and experimentation. He plays with materials, motion, and glitches, constantly trying (and occasionally failing) to make sense of the world through images.

    bio: "Specialising in video, my passion lies in the integration of graphics and motion design within film as a storytelling medium. With a strong background in graphic design and a focus on creating effective and accessible visual communication, my practice is guided by a commitment to clear narratives, the creative interplay between text and imagery, and the emotional resonance found in film aesthetics and movement. As a designer who values both film and graphic design, my studies have inspired me to explore animation and generative creative coding as tools for expressing emotion, abstract storytelling, and advocacy through visual media.",

The project reimagines a personal experience of dropping pebbles into a vase, an act both simple and rhythmic, through sound, texture, and movement. By evoking the tactile and sonic qualities of this memory, the work invites viewers to connect with the curiosity and imagination of childhood. Through color, sound, and visual abstraction,a fleeting and intimate recollection into an immersive narrative that celebrates the textures of memory",
