        <h3>Design Philosophy: The Pond of Emerging Works of our students</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="para-box rounded">
        <p>
          Welcome to the RMIT Digital Media Graduate Showcase 2025! <br /><br />
          This year's showcase takes shape as a digital pond. A living,
          reflective space where creative works surface, drift, and cohabit.<br /><br />
          Like a pond that gathers diverse life within one ecosystem, this
          platform brings together students from across digital media — UX/UI,
          3D modelling, sound, video, and interactive design — into a shared
          creative environment.<br /><br />
          Projects are not static portfolios but living entities, matured
          through time and now rising to the surface, ready to be seen,
          appreciated, and carried forward.<br /><br />
          The pond positions the showcase as a “space of emergence rather than
          completion”, moving away from the rigid, grid-like aesthetics that
          often define digital exhibitions. Instead, it embraces organic, fluid,
          and regenerative design principles that reflect how creativity truly
          unfolds dynamically and relationally.<br /><br />
          For graduating students, the pond honors a moment of transition: from
          the experimental world of learning to the professional world beyond.
          <br /><br />
          For the field of digital media, it proposes a more reflective and
          relational approach to showcasing, one that foregrounds care,
          emergence, and shared growth.<br /><br />
          We invite you to slow down and dwell into works of our students.
          <br /><br />
          See not only what has surfaced, but what continues to ripple and
          evolve below.
          <br /><br /><br /><br />
          Happy exploring!<br />
