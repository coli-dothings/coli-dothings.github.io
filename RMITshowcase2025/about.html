        Welcome to the RMIT Digital Media Graduate Showcase 2025! <br /><br />
        This year's showcase takes shape as a digital pond. A living, reflective
        space where creative works surface, drift, and cohabit.<br /><br />
        Like a pond that gathers diverse life within one ecosystem, this
        platform brings together students from across digital media — UX/UI, 3D
        modelling, sound, video, and interactive design — into a shared creative
        environment.<br /><br />
        Projects are not static portfolios but living entities, matured through
        time and now rising to the surface, ready to be seen, appreciated, and
        carried forward.<br /><br />
        The pond positions the showcase as a “space of emergence rather than
        completion”, moving away from the rigid, grid-like aesthetics that often
        define digital exhibitions. Instead, it embraces organic, fluid, and
        regenerative design principles that reflect how creativity truly unfolds
        dynamically and relationally.<br /><br />
        For graduating students, the pond honors a moment of transition: from
        the experimental world of learning to the professional world beyond.
        <br /><br />
        For the field of digital media, it proposes a more reflective and
        relational approach to showcasing, one that foregrounds care, emergence,
        and shared growth.<br /><br />
        We invite you to slow down and dwell into works of our students.
        <br /><br />
        See not only what has surfaced, but what continues to ripple and evolve
        below.<br /><br />
