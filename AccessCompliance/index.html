          <p>
            “Visage of Time” is an earnest attempt at grasping the concept of
            time, through the vision and hands of an illustrator, invited to be
            examined by a multitude of senses.
            <br /><br />
            “Time is a measurement of motion. Anything that measures time is a
            clock.”
            <br /><br />
            At the center of the exhibition is a pair of videos with set
            duration. A timelapse, a series of snapshots taken at an exact
            interval of 1 second after every brushstroke. Still images that the
            mind filled in the blanks to form an illusion of motion. Now playing
            back at the speed of 10 snapshots per second.
            <br /><br />
            The top video measured the streamlined path of time. Each frame
            progressed a set interval from the last, obvious and true in the way
            you can observe it grow and be refined. From a sketch, to colors, to
            a rough illustration.
            <br /><br />
            The bottom video, however, is the difference that lay between those
            2 frames. It showed the path of each new brushstroke, and of only
            that brushstroke. A snapshot of a movement, isolated from its
            surrounding context. A clock that runs without its hands, yet you
            can hear its ticks.
            <br /><br />
            Without the context of the first video, the second transforms into
            disconnected movements, regular in interval. It is a measurement of
            motion.
            <br /><br />
            A time, and a clock to measure it.
            <br /><br />
            The video is aided with use of audio descriptions and closed
            captions as part of the artistic practice.
          </p>
          <p id="side">
            On the side, accompanying the piece is a tactile print of the final
            illustration. With attention placed in texture to bring out areas of
            interest, and braille typeface where text used to be. It serves as
            another method to follow along the timed piece, by tracing your hand
            in its grooves and see, without eyes, how the movement of time could
            have felt like.

          <h3>Visage of Time - Full Transcript</h3>
          <p>
            The following video has 2 sections playing in synchrony. <br />
            This is for the top.<br />
            <i>&#x2022; And this is for the bottom.<br /></i>

            <br />
            White canvas.<br />
            <br />
            [background piano start]<br />
            <br />
            <i>&#x2022; Black lines dance on white snow.<br /></i>

            <br />
            Fast and fluid, tracing the outlines of invisible shapes. The
            sketching phase begins with loose outlines of people gathered in
            groups at corners of the canvas. Large ellipse shapes formed on the
            opposite corner. An oversized pocket watch, with interior exposed.
            <br />
            Lines hung on top of the open lid. A ladder support behind it.
            <br />
            More people occupy the space around the focal point, recontext as
            actions to jobs.
            <br /><br />
            [rolling piano notes]
            <br />
            [bell-like and fast paced with slow moving chords]
            <br /><br />
            A busy market place, a festival, unfurl in black lines and running
            stripes.
            <br /><br />
            The first of colors Pops.
            <br />
            Yellowed hues swirl around fabric banners hung up high, then down
            the clock.
            <br /><br />
            <i
              >&#x2022; Blues and yellows and greys sweep the screen, like ocean
              waves lapping the shoreline.</i
            >

            <br /><br />
            The first stage of color blocking settles in with large, unrefined
            strokes. A quick and simple method to lay down the colors of the
            whole scene yet wholly open to changes. Light grey ground, red tent
            in upper middle, golden clock over the right with blue and yellow
            banners swung overtop and outwards, drawing movement inwards. Dull
            grey marks the positions of people.
            <br /><br />
            <i
              >&#x2022; A maze of black lines flash across the blank
              landscape.</i
            >

            <br /><br />
            The previous sketch lines lighten significantly. Tentatively, the
            lower left corner darkened with sharp browns of wooden crates, grey
            cowls and yellow of the cloak the group of men wore.
            <br /><br />
            <i>&#x2022; The movement went shy, smaller and concentrated.</i>

            <br /><br />
            [rolling piano notes]
            <br />
            [unsettling chords shift from narrow to wide]
            <br /><br />
            Duller grey of poorer fabric emerges, speaking with a person in soft
            salmon pink, and undyed white sleeves and headdress. Decorative
            clock hand much larger than them held in their arms.
            <br /><br />
            <i
              >&#x2022; First painted grey, then switched to a soft yellow. Dark
              ropes scrawled in by their feet.</i
            >

            <br /><br />
            A lady in dark maroon and witch hat sat at the top left corner of
            the canvas, joined by another. Yellow and orange coat joined them,
            an interested buyer. A large brown ox-like creature covered by
            striped fabric looms behind, led by black coat lady with red, gold
            trimmed cowl. Clay brown disc with a triangle top raised on top, sun
            dial, pair of them, an ancient method to tell time, lay in front of
            the red ladies.
            <br /><br />
            The tent gained a new coat of bright red. The merchant donned orange
            with white cowl, and a large red hat matching the site. The sundial
            crew adjusted to be larger next to the gent.
            <br /><br />
            <i
              >&#x2022; Blues danced among the innards of the red tent, yet
              bearing yellow and purples on the canvas. An invisible contrast
              made visible. A unique illusion of colors.</i
            >
            <br /><br />
            [rolling piano notes, aimless]
            <br /><br />
            Another ox-creature bearing red and yellow fabric, white fur with a
            red mark on its forehead marches alongside a fellow in pink-salmon
            and white sleeves, dark planks held on their shoulder. Another
            worker. A grey child directs them towards the clock. Dark yellow
            streaks the open lid of the watch. Grey iron covers half the inner
            mechanism of it, previously soft yellow.
            <br /><br />
            <i
              >&#x2022; The small strokes quicken and dance in tight circular
              patterns. Shadows of shapes... flashes.</i
            >
            <br /><br />
            Darker gold covers the rest, defining the edges of gears and metal.
            A dark brown nob and darker ropes connect the clock. More people
            slowly painted in. Like the orange lady and blue child People help
            around the clock. Blue cowl and black dress hurried running at a
            person in red calling at them. Man in brown coat ponders. A couple
            in the back kneeling to examine shards of glass larger than both of
            them.
            <br /><br />
            <i
              >&#x2022; Streaks of color stay short and dance away faster across
              the wide space.</i
            >
            <br /><br />
            More characters in different shades filled the scene.
            <br /><br />
            [piano notes rolls and sways]
            <br /><br />
            The red tent expands further up, inline with perspective. A man on
            scaffolding behind the large pocket watch. Fabric banners grew
            fuller and vibrant before him. The dark ropes of the pocket watch
            snakes around the full canvas, dipping in and out of view. Small
            dark lines on the ground splintered outwards from the clock. Cracks
            on the pavement.
            <br /><br />
            <i>
              &#x2022; Small, almost invisible splinters of black dotted the
              blank scape.
            </i>
            <br /><br />
            [click] <i>&#x2022; A blink of grey across the white space.</i>
            <br /><br />
            The scene darken as shadows begin to form shapes Dark softened blues
            cast behind the tent where the red witches lay, appear purple under
            yellow dominant scene. Shadows cast behind every character on scene
            onto the ground, a low definition blob. Then cast upon the character
            themselves, the other half where the sun do not reach.
            <br /><br />
            [rolling piano notes]
            <br />
            [ocean waves slowly become noticeable]
            <br /><br />
            The ground previously stained by rough color blocks now cleaned, in
            preparation for a fresh coat of paint. New shapes of soft darkness
            painted in overtop of people. Shadows casted by translucent silk
            banners carry the hues of the banner, concentrated like filtered
            light lens.
            <br /><br />
            [rolling piano notes]
            <br />
            [very subtle rolling waves]
            <br /><br />
            The golden clock shifts to deeper copper hues. Reflective of the
            white ground and red hats. Patterns etched into its sides. The
            insides are casted in shadows of the lid, a hint of glow peaks
            through the cracks. Gold rim grows dark and reflects bold under
            sunlight.
            <br /><br />
            <i>
              &#x2022; Blinking dots jumbles and stutters, as finality nears.
            </i>
            <br /><br />
            The finishing touch is often invisible, yet loud in its absence.
            <br /><br />
            [rising piano volumes]
            <br />
            [clear rolling waves]
            <br /><br />
            An orange wash over the ground layer, basking the canvas in warmth.
            <br /><br />
            Handwritten text, in empty space left between the bustling of
            activities.
            <br />
            “We dance upon the ticking of clock hands as sun rises and moon
            falls.”
            <br />
            “Ephemeral and fleeting, the march of creation measured by man, in
            sounds and visuals."
            <br />
            "Does time march in static. In a medium without movement. In a
            medium without sounds.”

          <p>
            The tactile print is created using a grayscale version of the
            altered final illustration, removing some details to be easier to
            read, as well as replacing the original text with braille. Then
            translated into a height map with its darker areas becoming higher,
            and lighter lower.
            <br /><br />
            Areas of interest are painted using a heavily textured brush,
            leaving small grainy patches akin to dried streaky uneven thick
            paint in acrylic painting. This resulted in noticeable textures that
            can be felt for specific things, which include: People and animals,
            and the items sundials, the tent, and a clock gear. The outline of
            objects are cleanly separated by height.
            <br /><br />
            The print depicts a lively marketplace from a diagonal top-down
            view. In the bottom left corner, a wooden crate next to 5 people in
            long robes, standing roughly in a circle, with the farthest right
            holding a long thin clock arm.
            <br /><br />
            Directly up from them are 4 people. The 2 in the middle are sitting
            down, with large sundials in an elliptical with a triangle shape in
            front. Behind them is a large ox-like cattle, boxy frame and small
            head, being led by a person.
            <br /><br />
            The large tent is to the right of them. 2 diagonal wings leading
            inwards to a point high out of frame. 3 large staff holding the tent
            up. The merchant stands to the left of the middle staff, which is
            decorated by a sphere and hanging wares. Below the merchant are a
            pair of parent and child, the child holding a large bundle.
            <br /><br />
            To the right of the pair is another ox-like creature with horns,
            carrying fabric and wares on its back. A person behind and infront
            of it. The one in front carrying a large beam and being led by a
            small child, pointing to the right.
            <br /><br />
            Behind the ox and right of the tent is a large lady and a child
            hiding behind her, shadowed by the fabric banner.
            <br /><br />
            The bottom right half of the print is a very large pocket watch. The
            ellipse with small elliptical details in the bottom is the clock
            body exposed mechanism. 3 people are hauling a large gear into it.
            <br /><br />
            The upright ellipse is the lid of the pocket watch, with ladders set
            behind it and a person sitting on top. Silk banners, in long thin
            streaky texture leading outwards from the top of the lid, also
            casting shadows down below.
            <br /><br />
            Multiple people stand below the silk banner and half hidden by them.
            Including a pair kneeling on the ground in the middle, and another
            pair in the far right edge running towards a person (who is part of
            the 3 hauling the gear) waving at them.
            <br /><br />
            2 sets of braille. <br />
            The first set of braille sits between the lady with the large clock
            arm and the tent, which reads:<br />
            “We dance upon the ticking of clock hands as sun rises and moon
            falls.” <br /><br />
            The second set of braille sits between the pointing child and the
            clock:<br />
            “Ephemeral and fleeting, the march of creation measured by man, in
