            Captured in Still - Tactile print model <br />
            White PLA plastic, 3840x1080mm
          </h4>
          <p>
            The tactile print is created using a grayscale version of the
            altered final illustration, removing some details to be easier to
            read, as well as replacing the original text with braille. Then
            translated into a height map with its darker areas becoming higher,
            and lighter lower.
            <br /><br />
            Areas of interest are painted using a heavily textured brush,
            leaving small grainy patches akin to dried streaky uneven paint in
            acrylic painting. This resulted in noticeable textures that can be
            felt for specific things, which include: People and animals, and the
            items sundials, the tent, and a clock gear. The outline of objects
            are cleanly separated by height.
            <br /><br />
            The print depicts a lively marketplace from a diagonal top-down
            view. In the bottom left corner, a wooden crate next to 5 people in
            long robes, standing roughly in a circle, with the farthest right
            holding a long thin clock arm.
            <br /><br />
            Directly up from them are 4 people. The 2 in the middle are sitting
            down, with large sundials in an elliptical with a triangle shape in
            front. Behind them is a large ox-like cattle, boxy frame and small
            head, being led by a person.
            <br /><br />
            The large tent is to the right of them. 2 diagonal wings leading
            inwards to a point high out of frame. 3 large staff holding the tent
            up. The merchant stands to the left of the middle staff, which is
            decorated by a sphere and hanging wares. Below the merchant are a
            pair of parent and child, the child holding a large bundle.
            <br /><br />
            To the right of the pair is another ox-like creature with horns,
            carrying fabric and wares on its back. A person behind and infront
            of it. The one in front carrying a large beam and being led by a
            small child, pointing to the right.
            <br /><br />
            Behind the ox and right of the tent is a large lady and a child
            hiding behind her, shadowed by the fabric banner.
            <br /><br />
            The bottom right half of the print is a very large pocket watch. The
            ellipse with small elliptical details in the bottom is the clock
            body exposed mechanism. 3 people are hauling a large gear into it.
            <br /><br />
            The upright ellipse is the lid of the pocket watch, with ladders set
            behind it and a person sitting on top. Silk banners, in long thin
            streaky texture leading outwards from the top of the lid, also
            casting shadows down below.
            <br /><br />
            Multiple people stand below the silk banner and half hidden by them.
            Including a pair kneeling on the ground in the middle, and another
            pair in the far right edge running towards a person (who is part of
            the 3 hauling the gear) waving at them.
            <br /><br />
            2 sets of braille. <br />
            The first set of braille sits between the lady with the large clock
            arm and the tent, which reads:<br />
            “We dance upon the ticking of clock hands as sun rises and moon
            falls.” <br /><br />
            The second set of braille sits between the pointing child and the
            clock:<br />
            “Ephemeral and fleeting, the march of creation measured by man, in
            sounds and visuals. Does time march in static. In a medium without
            movement. In a medium without sounds.”
