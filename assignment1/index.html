        This is the first page.
        The frontPage div is for an invisible grid that can arrange 
        text elements into, and define border for background image.
        The text elements are put into div to be styled sub-grid, except
        'oart' because vertical text react strangely to it.
        The headings will use a different font family to paragraph.

        The main page section.
        I intend to use a grid system, with each question is contained 
        in a box in each div. 'mainPage' is the grid container.
  
        The main grid is fully designed in a physical note prior to coding,
        for smoother coding. Though some details are improvised.
  
        All question numbers are heading level 3, more for navigation 
        accessibility later on. For now I use the class to style.
        There is also the 'accent' class, for accent color.
  
        'boxMainGrid' is the class so I can style box background. ID is for
        indentification when I start arranging them in the grid.

          The rapid firing bold text of the loading screen was the first thing I

          Hovering before clicking on elements to see how each would react, if

          main menu. Hovering more so than clicking, as it had more interactions
          built in and encompass mouse movement interactions as a whole. <br />
          Examples: Image tilt in 3D, color background change, hover pops up.

          The primary goal is for showcasing the talent and out of the box,
          modern graphical design capability of the web designer, through layout
          and programming interactions. Separate it from standard websites,
          meaning to hit hard with first impression. Extremely user friendly in
          terms of interactions, but not accommodating to all users.

        <p class="answer accent">
          Since the loading screen, an overload amounts to interactive or moving
          elements, including the cursor itself. Flashy approach to the design,
          with everything made to be attention grabbing. Even the typography was
          used as a design element to be interacted with, over an informative
          one. <br />
          Especially done with modern technology in mind, with an overload of
          moving elements that would require some level of fast internet and
          computing power. <br />
          The lack of accessibility in menu, headings in html, font size, meant
          the website is not built for general access.

        <p class="answer">
          The experience should be quick and snappy, a quick impressive look
          through, with pausing on each new novel interactive elements, but
          ultimately not for long, or recurring visits.

        <p class="answer accent">
          Using only one way to navigate which is by scrolling, with no
          comprehensive menu, it created a one way road experience, with little
          branching or back and forth. And by making almost everything
          interactable, it made everything attention grabbing, which is good for
          first impressions. The lack of clear menu UI made it difficult to
          quickly skip to specific contents, and became a hassle to navigate
          once the novelty wore off. <br />
          All additional sites are available on one single plus sign element
          that is always available, meaning navigating out to check other sites
          of the designer is significantly more accessible.

          What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act
          when engaging with your research experience?

        <p class="answer">
          Be dazzled scrolling through the movements of every element, but not
          necessarily lingering on any texts. Absorb the experience of
          interacting with and navigating a website as an experience itself.
          With its complexity in presentation. Linger on visual/graphical
          elements, but not for long. <br />
          Check out resources/additional items within it to see other products
          done by the same entity, and move to purchase when sufficiently
          impressed. <br />
          These are functions of good advertisement, the window displays of high
          end stores or eye-catching posters of concerts. Names and important
          indentify information, branding are bold. The information for payment
          processing or commission details are often elsewhere, not to deter
          customers but seen when they are about to buy in.

        <p class="answer">
          Fascination, excitement over discovery of a new interaction (ie: tilt,
          mouse track circle expand) High energy. Wanting to see what's next
          constantly, and moving on from the last. <br />
          This showed a focus on presentation, on being eye catching, an
          interactive art piece over a clear and concise portfolio meant for
          information. Which worked well as a piece of advertisement, or a way
          to promote the portfolio of the designer himself. But also the modern
          trends of being more technical advance, higher energy, less attention
          span.

          What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what
          makes that part frustrating?
        </p>
        <p class="answer accent">
          The lack of obvious, clear basic UI elements, such as menu bar, making
          it disorienting. This meant how to navigate the page was unclear at
          the start, and annoying on repeating visit. <br />
          Biggest problem is the overt use of moving elements. Especially on the
          already small display fonts, making it even harder to read. Every
          image tilts when scroll, color jumbles when mouse hover. More images
          shown on mouse hover over text. The background video is moving.
          Everything demands attention, which muddles the focal point. Long
          experience creates motion sickness.

          makes that part satisfying?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          Innovative use of website layouts. Better to understand as a graphical
          piece than an actual informative piece. Typography is hard to read but
          becomes interesting once understood as more a graphical element,
          though it still, even if overlooked, carries its uses as information
          as well.
          <br />
          Layers of interaction, from the mouse to movement of elements in
          relation to mouse position, velocity, scroll speed and scroll
          direction. It feels as though the designer wanted interactions, and
          doubled down on nailing it.
